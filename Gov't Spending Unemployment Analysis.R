# This plot replicates Taylor’s scatter plot for the period 1990Q1–2010Q3. 
  # A clear positive relationship between government purchases and unemployment is evident, supported by the linear trend line.
  # The scatter plot demonstrates a strong positive relationship between government purchases as a percentage of GDP and unemployment, 
  # with a regression slope of 1.07709. This slope indicates that for every 1% increase in government purchases (as a percentage of GDP), unemployment increases by approximately 1.08 percentage points.
# Key Observation: Taylor’s period shows a unique trend that is not evident in other periods. This trend may suggest that Taylor’s sample was specifically chosen to support his argument.

# The R-squared values provide a measure of how much variation in unemployment can be explained by government 
  # purchases as a percentage of GDP within each time period. For Taylor’s selected period (1990Q1–2010Q3), 
  # the R-squared value is relatively high, indicating a stronger fit and supporting Taylor’s claim of a positive 
  # relationship. However, the pre-Taylor period (<1990Q1) and post-Taylor period (>2010Q3) show significantly lower 
  # R-squared values, suggesting that the relationship is weaker or inconsistent over time. 
  # This variability highlights the lack of robustness in Taylor’s findings and supports Wolfers' critique that the 
  # observed correlation may be a product of selective sampling rather than a generalizable economic relationship.

# Comparing the periods shows distinct trends. The pre-Taylor period shows weaker relationships, 
  # while the post-Taylor period exhibits a stronger positive correlation. The overlay of regression lines highlights these differences.
# In the pre-Taylor period (<1990Q1), the relationship between government purchases and unemployment is either weak 
  # or slightly negative. The slope of the regression line here is less than Taylor’s slope, indicating an 
  # inconsistent relationship during this time.
# In the post-Taylor period (>2010Q3), the relationship becomes stronger but continues in the same positive direction.
# Key Observation: Taylor’s selected sample (1990Q1–2010Q3) isolates a unique period where the relationship is 
  # especially pronounced. This aligns with Wolfers’ critique that Taylor may have cherry-picked his data to highlight a desired narrative.

# The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that achieving a correlation as high as Taylor’s (0.803) is extremely unlikely in 
  # randomly generated, uncorrelated data. None of the 1000 simulated cherry-picked correlations exceeded this value, 
  # providing strong evidence that Taylor’s observed correlation is an outlier. This result aligns with Wolfers’ critique, 
  # suggesting that Taylor’s choice of sample period may have been deliberately selective to produce a statistically favorable 
  # outcome. While it is not possible to definitively prove intent, the data strongly indicate that the observed correlation does 
  # not reflect a broader or consistent relationship between government purchases and unemployment.

# The simulation shows that cherry-picked correlations often exceed full-sample correlations. 
# The proportion of simulated correlations exceeding Taylor's value of 0.803 supports Wolfers' critique of potential cherry-picking.
# The Monte Carlo simulation shows that cherry-picked correlations (red histogram) are systematically higher than full-sample correlations (blue histogram). 
# The boxplot comparison further emphasizes this pattern, showing higher medians and interquartile ranges for cherry-picked correlations.
# Key Numerical Insight: The proportion of cherry-picked correlations exceeding Taylor’s value of 0.803 is 0% in this simulation. 
# This suggests that achieving a correlation as high as Taylor’s purely from random data (without any true relationship) is unlikely. 
# While this weakens the claim of cherry-picking in a statistical sense, it does not completely invalidate Wolfers’ critique.



# CONCLUSIONS # 

# Addressing Wolfers’ Critique
# Wolfers’ argument centers on the inconsistency of the relationship Taylor presented over different time periods. The evidence in your analysis supports this critique:
  # Pre-Taylor and post-Taylor periods show different relationships, indicating that the correlation in Taylor’s sample is not representative of the overall dataset.
  # Taylor’s correlation does not align with the results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation, suggesting it may not have arisen purely by chance. However, the choice of this specific time period amplifies the relationship, which can be interpreted as selective sampling.

# Taylor’s Worldview
  # Taylor’s argument about the positive relationship between government purchases and unemployment during his selected timeframe is statistically valid but lacks robustness across other periods.
  # The evidence suggests that Taylor’s conclusion cannot be generalized beyond his chosen timeframe, which aligns with Wolfers’ critique of potential cherry-picking.
